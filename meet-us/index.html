            Northland Christian Counseling Center (NCCC) is an
            inter-denominational ministry designed to supplement the work of
            Christian churches in the Greater Grand Forks area and surrounding
            community. It was established by the Greater Grand Forks area
            Evangelical Pastors' Fellowship and is governed by a board made up
            of pastors, lay persons, and professionals. NCCC is incorporated
            under the laws of North Dakota as a non-profit, tax-exempt
            corporation and depends, in part, on contributions of friends.
            Client fees cover only part of our expenses. If you would like to
            help and/or you have been helped by our services, would you consider
            a donation or regular contribution to this ministry? Thank you; all

                    My passion is to walk alongside those struggling with their
                    faith and those who have questions about pain and suffering.
                    It is because of my own brokenness that I feel God can use
                    me to touch another’s soul; just as God has used individuals
                    in my life to touch my soul. I desire to open my heart more
                    and more to God, so that He can shine through my life and
                    guide those through their own journey.

                    Problems are always easier to solve when one has the help
                    of someone who cares. If you have been trying to problem
                    solve on your own or avoiding issues in your relationship
                    that hold you back from realizing your full potential, both
                    personally and in a relationship, come see me! With the help
                    of God, I will help you make positive changes in your life
                    &mdash;both immediate and lasting. My mission is to provide
                    a safe place where hope and healing connect in order for
                    people to change their lives. Together we will work towards
                    solving any problems that may be standing in your way
                    towards experiencing peace.

                    We are often tempted by worldly desires or idols (substance
                    abuse, gambling, pornography, etc.) that can take a foothold
                    in our lives and drive wedges between us and God and others
                    in our lives.  Counseling is a venue that can be used to
                    identify those desires and/or idols that stand between us
                    and our relationships with God and others. It serves as a
                    vehicle for us to develop the primary principle presented in
                    1 Corinthians 10:13. With Christ, there is always a way out
                    of any temptation this world has to offer.
