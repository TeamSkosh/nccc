            Northland Christian Counseling Center (NCCC) is an
            inter-denominational ministry designed to supplement the work of
            Christian churches in the Greater Grand Forks area and surrounding
            community. It was established by the Greater Grand Forks area
            Evangelical Pastors' Fellowship and is governed by a board made up
            of pastors, lay persons, and professionals. NCCC is incorporated
            under the laws of North Dakota as a non-profit, tax-exempt
            corporation and depends, in part, on contributions of friends.
            Client fees cover only part of our expenses. If you would like to 
            help and/or you have been helped by our services, would you consider
            a donation or regular contribution to this ministry? Thank you; all
            gifts are tax deductible.
