            Northland Christian Counseling Center (NCCC) is an
            inter-denominational ministry designed to supplement the work of
            Christian churches in the Greater Grand Forks area and surrounding
            community. It was established by the Greater Grand Forks area
            Evangelical Pastors' Fellowship and is governed by a board made up
            of pastors, lay persons, and professionals. NCCC is incorporated
            under the laws of North Dakota as a non-profit, tax-exempt
            corporation and depends, in part, on contributions of friends.
            Client fees cover only part of our expenses. If you would like to
            help and/or you have been helped by our services, would you consider
            a donation or regular contribution to this ministry? Thank you; all
            gifts are tax deductible.

                    My passion is to walk alongside those struggling with their
                    faith and those who have questions about pain and suffering.
                    It is because of my own brokenness that I feel God can use
                    me to touch another’s soul; just as God has used individuals
                    in my life to touch my soul. I desire to open my heart more
                    and more to God, so that He can shine through my life and
                    guide those through their own journey.

                    It takes a great deal of courage to face life sometimes, and
                    to look inside ourselves with honesty. I consider it an
                    honor to be invited to listen and be present with people in
                    their pain. God has given me a heart for coming alongside
                    others in the difficulties of life, encouraging the renewal
                    and restoration that God has for each of us along the way.
                    Just as I see a need in my life to depend on God more fully,
                    I love inviting others to do the same, and to explore what
                    may get in the way. I bring over 30 years of experience, 20
                    of those with Northland, serving those facing depression,
                    anxiety, grief, loss, relationship matters, sexual abuse,
                    body image issues, and more. I would be honored to join you
                    on a journey of healing.

                    My passion is helping people throughout the lifespan, to
                    achieve physical, mental and spiritual well-being.
                    Identifying and recognizing their God given strengths and
                    guiding them to see the love of God and the purpose He has
                    for them starts them on the path to healing. I have helped
                    many reach their personal goals through, counseling,
                    education, assessment, diagnosis and treatment as well as
                    coaching lifestyle changes, including nutrition,
                    supplements, exercise and walking as Christ would have them
                    walk. As a support group leader for caregivers of those with
                    dementia, I have guided people through end of life issues.
                    Many Christian mentors, including those who have been
                    through deep valleys, yet live with joy and peace, have
                    strengthened my faith and my ability to understand and help
                    others.

                    I have a passion for helping people on their journey because
                    of how I have personally experienced Jesus using my own
                    brokenness to free and heal me. I love coming alongside of
                    people stuck in shame and guilt and helping them to see what
                    grace, forgiveness and healing can look like in their life.
                    My primary goal is to point people to Jesus, the only source
                    of healing, and to help them see what may get in the way of
                    union with Him, such as attachment to performance and
                    perfectionism, faulty thinking patterns, or unresolved pain
                    from the past that contribute to unhealthy relationships with
                    self, others and God. I have seen many people confront hard
                    issues in their life when given grace and compassion, moving
                    on to experience true inner freedom and healing.

                    I consider it a great privilege to be allowed into my
                    clients' healing journeys. My belief is that we are all
                    consistently on a journey toward healing and that this path
                    is not a linear one. I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all
                    modality of treatment, and I welcome using personal stories
                    and insights to guide the healing process. I have seen how
                    many Christians and non-Christians, alike, mistake their
                    negative emotional experiences as “sinful” or “wrong” and
                    work hard to avoid or “fix” these emotions through
                    self-shame and self-deprecation. My goal is to assist my
                    clients in learning from these unpleasant emotions and
                    listening to their message. I believe Jesus is the ultimate
                    mentor for learning self-compassion and I welcome their
                    spiritual beliefs and practices in whatever capacities they
                    find most restoring. It has been through my own brokenness
                    that I have learned to be receptive to grace and my hope is
                    that my clients will be receptive to healing through God’s
                    unconditional love.

                    Can the Christian Faith really supply answers to life's
                    deepest struggles? With a deep, emphatic yes, I do believe
                    the "Faith" does supply real healing in the human heart. My
                    heart resonates with the message of the Gospel that brings
                    hope for the broken hearted. This message is one of my
                    deepest passions.

                    I enjoy working with people of all ages and supporting them
                    in their journey toward healing and growth. I believe that
                    our faith is an important factor in mental health that
                    should be considered and incorporated in treatment. I
                    believe in taking a strengths-based approach and that
                    Christianity is a tremendous asset possess that can help us
                    through our deepest struggles. By asking “How can we utilize
                    our Christianity to overcome barriers?” we are using the
                    strengths that are already there.  Coming to terms with and
                    knowing ourselves only deepens our faith.  I believe that
                    Jesus can teach us a great deal about compassion,
                    forgiveness, grace and unconditional love. Each of us is
                    uniquely created and it is privilege to walk alongside
                    people as they overcome challenges and grow.
