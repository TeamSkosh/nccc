                <p>
                    Northland Christian Counseling Center believes that God, through the
                    Lord Jesus Christ, has all power to guide and carry people through the
                    hurt, uncertainty, and pain of their lives. In the process of counseling
                    and within the context of a caring community of believers, each
                    individual client is offered healing, restoration, strength, love and
                    comfort.

                    <p class="services--overview-point-description">
                        Co-Dependency is a self-focused way of life in which a
                        person, blind to his or her true self, continually
                        reacts to others being controlled by and seeking to
                        control their behavior, attitudes, and/or opinions,
                        resulting in spiritual sterility, loss of authenticity
                        and absence of intimacy.  A co-dependent person is
                        “addicted,” not to a destructive substance, but to a
                        destructive pattern of relating to other people, a
                        pattern usually learned from childhood in an abusive or
                        non-nurturing home.  Codependency holds a person hostage
                        to other people’s behaviors, moods, or opinions, and the
                        codependent bases his or her worth and actions on
                        someone else’s life.  It’s a terrible bondage.
