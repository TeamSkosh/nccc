                    discovered a life-long gratitude for spending time with Bill.

                    years. While there he developed an effective character
                    development training program, which nurtured visionaries such as
                    Kit Danley, founder of Neighborhood Ministries.

                    In his spare time, Bill can be found fishing, golfing, crafting
