                    Northland Christian Counseling Center believes that God, through the
                    Lord Jesus Christ, has all power to guide and carry people through the
                    hurt, uncertainty, and pain of their lives. In the process of counseling
                    and within the context of a caring community of believers, each
                    individual client is offered healing, restoration, strength, love and
                    comfort.
