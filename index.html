            One Day Can Make a Difference

            I called Northland Christian Counseling Center, desperate, wanting
            to end my life. The clinician promised to get me in early the next
            day. I knew I could make it one more day, knowing I was going to get
            help soon. But I don’t think I could have waited much longer.

            So began my journey at NCCC. When my counselor gave me a
            book/workbook at the end of the first session, I remember thinking,
            “13 Chapters. I should be done and feeling better in 13 weeks.” It
            was not to be.

            I was struggling with clinical depression. High levels of anxiety
            and panic attacks were daily occurrences for me. My thoughts often
            drifted towards suicide. Recovery was slower than I expected. Soon
            I was on medication for depression and anxiety.

            Week after week we worked through some difficult issues in my life
            stemming from childhood sexual abuse. My counselor was patient with
            me as he introduced me to truth. At times I just wanted to give up.
            But God continued to work in my life through His Word, the
            encouragement, teaching, and insight from my counselor, and the
            prayers and support of my husband and family. My physical,
            spiritual, mental and emotional health was being restored! Healing
            was taking place.

            I’m very grateful for the ministry of NCCC and the care I received
            while a client there. My life has changed and continues to change
            from the inside out. <strong>I can celebrate a life filled with
            hope!</strong>
