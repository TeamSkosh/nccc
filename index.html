            Northland Christian Counseling Center believes that God, through the
            Lord Jesus Christ, has all power to guide and carry people through the
            hurt, uncertainty, and pain of their lives. In the process of counseling
            and within the context of a caring community of believers, each
            individual client is offered healing, restoration, strength, love and
            comfort.
