            Your electronic donations, gifts and investments are greatly
            appreciated. Your support and partnership help our Client Assistance
            Fund. Currently many of our clients are unable to pay their fees.
            The Client Assistance Fund has been created to provide counseling to
            those in need but without resources to pay. Northland Christian
            Counseling Center provides various financial opportunities to make
            donations and invest in what the Lord is doing at the Center and in
            the local communities. Contributions may be given by mail or online.
            Please select “Donate with Impact Button” below for online use.
